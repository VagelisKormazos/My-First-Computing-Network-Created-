Here it should be: 
1) Implement the topology with the software provided. In cases where no IP is given
addresses will have to be calculated by you and assigned to the corresponding interfaces of the
routers. Note that the given IP addresses correspond to the IPs of the networks of the
topology networks - excluding the IP address of the atom server.
2) To check the interconnectivity between the stations in the topology use the
ping tool from the command line interface (CLI).
3) Calculate the size of the networks in the topology (in terms of the number of IP addresses available).
addresses).
4) The atom server serves the HTTP service. Place the appropriate code on it
(index.html) so that it displays a simple web page with the title of the graduate school, the
